🌟 Project Description: Prayer App with a Growth Mindset

In our journey toward self-improvement and spiritual growth, I’m developing an Islamic Prayer App that will serve as a daily companion, reminding users of their prayer times while fostering mindfulness, consistency, and self-discipline in faith. Here's the breakdown of the app’s vision and purpose:

🕋 Core Purpose: A platform to offer real-time prayer time notifications, based on the user’s location. The app aims to serve the global Muslim community by integrating cities and countries worldwide, ensuring accurate prayer times.

🎯 Growth Mindset Approach:

📚 Continuous Learning: Every step of this project is an opportunity for growth. By integrating prayer APIs, managing real-time data, and building a responsive UI, I will continually enhance my skills in web development. Each challenge encountered is not a barrier, but a stepping stone to new knowledge.

🚀 Embrace New Technologies: The project will use modern tools like Python, Streamlit, and public APIs to fetch accurate prayer times. Adopting new frameworks and keeping up with evolving trends in technology are critical in my path to growth and innovation.

💪 Persistence and Adaptability: Debugging and optimizing this app will require persistence. With each bug and code challenge, I aim to maintain patience, refine my approach, and adapt where needed. Failures are opportunities to grow stronger and wiser.

❤️ Purposeful Creation: The app is more than just a technical project—it's an avenue to make a positive impact. By building this app, I hope to help Muslims around the world stay consistent in their prayers. This project allows me to serve a higher purpose while honing my craft.

🔧 Key Features:

🌍 Location-based prayer times: Automatically detect user location for accurate prayer times.
🔔 Prayer notifications: Alert users before each prayer with adjustable reminders.
🕌 Qibla Direction: An integrated compass that helps users find the direction of the Kaaba for prayer.
📅 Islamic calendar: A built-in Islamic calendar for important dates and holidays.
📖 Dua & Quran: A collection of daily duas and Quranic verses to inspire users spiritually.
💡 Final Thoughts: This project will not only grow my technical expertise but also allow me to develop resilience, persistence, and creativity. With each iteration, I will move closer to becoming a well-rounded developer and individual—a lifelong learner dedicated to serving others and constantly improving.

With this growth mindset, the Prayer App will be a powerful tool for spiritual and personal development, benefitting users while enhancing my skills in tech and design. 🌱✨
